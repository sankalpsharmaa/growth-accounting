    \maketitle

\noindent \textit{Collect annual time-series data on real, fixed price (ideally) or chained GDP, $Y_t$, current price GDP, $NOMY_t$, current price gross investment, $NOMI_t$, hours worked, $H_t$, and the working age population, $POP_t$ for}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{United States}
    \item \textit{United Kingdom }
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textit{for the same sample period. Ideally, the sample period should be at the latest from 1970 through 2019. It can be a little shorter if one of the countries has a shorter sample period than this available.}
\\
\\    
\textit{Do not attempt to collect data for 2020 or 2021, as they are affected by the pandemic. Check BEA (US), Eurostat, FRED, IMF, OECD, World Bank, and UK-specific sources. Construct the working age population of each country using U.N. Population Estimates data by summing over the population aged 16 through 65 or 20 through 69 or similar.}
\\
\\
\textit{Make the following calculations for each of the countries.}
\\
\\
a. \textbf{Construct a real investment series by calculating} $$I_t = \frac{NOMI_t}{P_t}$$

where $NOMI_t$ is current price investment and $P_t$ is the GDP fixed price deflator. The latter is the ratio of current price to constant price GDP, $$ P_t = \frac{NOMI_t}{Y_t}$$

\textbf{Answer:}
